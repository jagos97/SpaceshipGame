This assignment was finished on Visual studio windows 10 with opengl 4.6.
You can play the game using the 'w' and 's' keys to move forward and backwards respectively.
Left-click on the screen to rotate the ship. The ship will face the location of the click, it is not based on the center of the screen.
The game automatically resets when a fire touches you but you can reset the game at any time by pressing space.
Enjoy :)
